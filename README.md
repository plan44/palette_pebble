[![Flattr this git repo](http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=luz&url=https://github.com/plan44/palette_pebble&title=palette%20-%20Colorful%20watch%20face&language=&tags=github&category=software)

This watchface uses 61 of 64 possible colors of the new Pebble Time display to create simple hour and minute time display. The hands are represented by the hard contrast between PastelYellow (nearly white) and OxfordBlue (nearly black). White and the two grays are not used, black is only used for the background. The other 60 colors each represent one minute's angle.
